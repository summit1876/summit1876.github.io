      <description>I created my portfolio website using Hugo and UIKit, it serves as an online resume containing all my work.
This has been created as a theme so that others can use and adapt it.
Sections Homepage The homepage provides the basic information about you, including links to social media, skills you have, things you&amp;rsquo;ve done and your education. This page makes good use of UIKit grid and cards for organising all the information and ensuring it is responsive to work on mobile devices.</description>

LyricsYeah, yeah ohYeah, yeah yeahThat&amp;rsquo;s the way everyday goesEvery time we&amp;rsquo;ve no controlIf the sky is pink and whiteIf the ground is black and yellowIt&amp;rsquo;s the same way you showed meNod my head, don&amp;rsquo;t close my eyesHalfway on a slow moveIt&amp;rsquo;s the same way you showed meIf you could fly then you&amp;rsquo;d feel southUp north&amp;rsquo;s getting cold soonThe way it is, we&amp;rsquo;re on landSo I&amp;rsquo;m someone to hold trueKeep you cool when it&amp;rsquo;s still aliveWon&amp;rsquo;t let you down when it&amp;rsquo;s all ruinJust the same way you showed me, showed meYou showed me loveGlory from aboveRegard my dearIt&amp;rsquo;s all downhill from hereIn the wake of a hurricaneDark skin of a summer shadeNosedive in the flood linesTall tower of milk cratesIt&amp;rsquo;s the same way you showed meCannonball off the porch sideOlder kids trying off the roofJust the same way you showed me (You showed)If you could die and come back to lifeUp for air from the swimming poolYou&amp;rsquo;d kneel down to the dry landKiss the Earth that birthed youGave you tools just to stay aliveAnd make it out when the sun is ruinedThat&amp;rsquo;s the same way you showed me, showed meYou showed me loveGlory from aboveRegard my dearIt&amp;rsquo;s all downhill from hereRemember lifeRemember how it wasClimb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends hereSay what up to Matthew, to ShoobSay what up to DannySay what up to life immortalityBending up my NikesRunning out the melpomene, nicotineStealing granny cigs (Take it easy)Gimme something sweetBitch, I might like immortalityThis is life, life immortalitySource: MusixmatchSongwriters: Pharrell Williams / Frank OceanPink + White lyrics Â© Heavens Research, More Water From Nazareth, Emi Pop Music Publishing</description>
